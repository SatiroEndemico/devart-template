# Instructions

The template you forked is the basis for your code repository on DevArt. 

This repository is where you will configure your Project page on DevArt site. It is also where you will build your code and document your process.  Your page on DevArt will change every time you make changes to your code and push this repository to GitHub. All submissions in GitHub will need to be entered in English. 

Your Project page on DevArt  is made up of three parts: 

**1. Project Description**

**2. Project Technologies**

**3. Project Posts**

All updates are made using [Github Flavoured Markdown Language](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown) language. Make sure your files use the GH Flavoured formatting.

## Updating your Project Page

### 1. Craft your Project Description
This is where you describe your project title, idea, vision and where the final results of your project are displayed. We encourage you to add images, videos, and links to final working versions of your project in this section. This can be edited as many times as you want. This will be the first thing judges will look at when they go to your Project page. The more complete, the better.

> Edit **project_description.md** with information about your project following the example provided in the file, commit and push your changes to GitHub and to update the description area of your Project page.

### 2. Enter your Project Technologies
This is where you define which technologies you use for your project. Make sure all technologies entered fit in either of the categories: ```LANGUAGES```, ```TOOLKITS```, ```API’S```,```PLATFORMS```. You can also add themes as tags (e.g: ```particles```, ```space```, ```dreams```). By creating a list of technologies, your project will be searchable and filtered by the different categories in the gallery.


> Edit  **project_technologies.json**  using with the example JSON structure, commit and push your changes to GitHub to update the project technologies. Make sure your JSON conforms to the structure of the template and is validated.


### 3. Update your Project Posts
This section is like a blog of your progress. This is where you will document your process—from early napkin sketches to versions of prototypes to the finished project. As soon as you have a rough idea of your project, you should create a Project Post. Your posts must show your progress as they will be viewed by the judges and taken into consideration during the judging process. On each post you can add a title, description, images and any other process documentation you find relevant using GitHub markdown. 

> Locate  the **project_posts/** folder, duplicate the example post using the same naming convention **YYYY-MM-DD-POST-TITLE.MD** updating the date, edit the post, commit and push your changes to GitHub. DevArt reads  posts use the [Github Flavoured Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown) format, so make sure you are naming them correctly and using the GitHub markdown.

## Start early and post often
DevArt is as much about the process as it is about the finished piece. Again, judges will be taking your updates into consideration during the judging process. Make sure your updates have media content, including images (screenshots of your project, or pictures of sketches) and videos of prototypes and work in progress.

## Your final submission
Your final submission is your full Project Page with three sections: Project Description, Project Posts and Project Technologies.  The Project Page is what will be judged by the judges. Read the judging criteria on the Enter Now page on the DevArt site.

Please double-check to make sure:

1. Your Project Description section includes your project name, a detailed description of your work and supporting images and videos. If possible, include a link to a working version of your project.
2. Your Project Technologies includes keywords for all themes explored and technologies used for your project.
3. You have at least 5 Project Posts demonstrating your progress, including one or more images and description for each post.
