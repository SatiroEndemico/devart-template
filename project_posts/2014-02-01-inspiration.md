#Sources of inspiration

David Byrne, Brian Eno  My Life in the Bush of Ghosts

[This album](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Life_in_the_Bush_of_Ghosts_(album)) from the 1980’s was one of the first to use sampling as the foreground, and I’ve constantly looked to it as a source of inspiration.  Can you paint sonically with short pieces of sound?    This album suggests interesting ways of working with human voice and processing it algorithmically.  Eno says, 

> No, there was already a history of it. People such as Holger Czukay had made experiments using IBM Dictaphones and short-wave radios and so on. The difference was, I suppose, that I decided to make it the lead vocal on the album My Life in the Bush of Ghost

This project sampled a choir of singers individually and uses a ring of speakers to show how the whole is made out of small, individual voices

David Byrne’s [Playing the Building](http://www.davidbyrne.com/art/art_projects/playing_the_building/)

which used mechanical systems to vibrate the building at different frequencies.

Internet Radio

Deeply inspired by how you can eavesdrop on cultures from many parts of the globe. 

James Clar’s [Moment in Time Defined by a Point and a Line

This sculpture shows the bullet trajectories in the assassinations of Malcolm X, King Fasal and Amadou Dialo.    One of the things I’m interested in exploring around this project is orientation and angle -- which way are you facing and how that relates to the rest of the world.  It’s important to remember that lines and angles have meaning.  This sculpture articulates the point that geometry can have profound significance.


Kenneth Goldsmith - Uncreative Writing

This book presents an interesting argument for poetry that’s based on words and language that already exists.  As a teacher Kenneth Goldsmith teaches writing classes where students are not allowed to write any new words, the class focuses on plagiarism, remixing, tools for aquiring and scraping text, etc.   He writes: 

> The world is full of texts, more or less interesting; I do not wish to add any more.’ It seems an appropriate response to a new condition in writing today: faced with an unprecedented amount of available text, the problem is not needing to write more of it; instead, we must learn to negotiate the vast quantity that exists. How I make my way through the thicket of information — how I manage it, how I parse it, how I organize and distribute it — is what distinguishes my writing from yours.

I think there’s something really interesting here and an argument for an artform that’s centered around collecting / manipulating media.    In the case of this project, I’m focusing on the sounds from around the world, but the idea is similar.  Let’s make something from all these things that exist.  Let’s have an art form that’s around navigating the thicket of information, that’s about parsing and reorganizing in imaginative ways. 

Parag Mital - Visual Similarity Videos

[Parag Mital](http://pkmital.com/home/) is a academic researcher who generates amazing artwork based on his findings - he’s been focusing on visual similarity, using small parts of images to match other images, reconstituting videos with fragments of imagery from other videos.   I find his work visually stunning,

In the last video, he uses the content of the video itself to formulate newer things the video sees.  There’s a moment in that video where the camera, pointed at a keyboard, replaces all the keys with the letter ‘k’ since all the keys look like that tiny fragment.   To me this represents something magical about computation and fragmentary matching, that this is the kind of hallucination of the computer, how the computer dreams.   

Listening Post - Ben Rubin / Mark Hansen

On a personal note, this is my all time favorite media artwork.  What I love about it is that attempts to collect and live in a data stream, and it shows both the individual voice and the collective voice.
