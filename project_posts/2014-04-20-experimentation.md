Here's some experimentation with audio processing, in this case adding bandpass filtering and reverb, which seems to help emphasize notes but can sound a bit shrill on the higher notes (and the reverb is a bit much!):

I'm using freeverb, a great old school library for doing reverb and a great [c++ library of DSP code for bandpass filters](https://github.com/vinniefalco/DSPFilters).

I think there's some harshness in the playback so envelopes will also help alot here.

Here's some experimentation with showing where the notes are coming from.  I want to great a kind of abstract map, I'm still grapling with how to map sounds without it looking like:

Here, notes build out the map in some way:
