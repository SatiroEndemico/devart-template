# This is the title of a post with images and videos

This is the example of how you can add images to your project. Remember that the image source link can refer either to an image hosted on the repository:

![Devart](../project_images/logo.png?raw=true "Google Devart Logo")

or to an externally hosted image:

![Alt text](http://www.creativeapplications.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/kinematics_nervous_system_01-copy.jpg "Image Title Text")

You can also embed videos from Youtube: just add a link to a video and DevArt will take care of showing it in the post: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oz5lYp6XauA
