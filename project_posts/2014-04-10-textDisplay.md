We're slowly working through the physical design of the installation -- using beams the hold panels of felt and hold up speakers along with text displays that will show the city and country the sound is coming from. 

here's a mockup of the installation design:

here you can see the text display below the speaker:

We're currently testing different display technologies -- one that we particularly like is [VFD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_fluorescent_display) (vacuum flouresecnt display).   We used one from Noritake which we are driving using an arduino.  The info [here](http://www.instructables.com/id/Arduino-and-the-Noritake-24x6-VFD-Module-Vacuum-Fl/) was really helpful.

there a small snippet of code on our blog [here](http://www.yesyesno.com/blog/2014/4/23/noritake-vfd-cu-y-series).
